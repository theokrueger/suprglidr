** WTF is a Superglide?
The Superglide is a frame-perfect movement tech in Apex Legends that allows you to gain a large amount of instant horizontal velocity after a wallclimb.
It is very advantageous in combat and general traversal.

The Superglide is tied to your framerate, as you must press jump then crouch on the exact next frame.
This means that the trick is trivial on 60FPS due to a larger window, but is very difficult on 240FPS.

** How to use
Don't use it.

*** Deviation
Set a random deviation amount (0-100% of a frame).

Defaults to 0.

*** FPS
Set your framerate cap (ensure that the game is capped at that framerate and you are actually reaching that framerate).

Defaults to 240

*** Jump bind
Set your jump key.

Defaults to <SPACE>

*** Crouch bind
Set your crouch key.

Defaults to <V>

** Is this cheating?
Yes. So are Hall Effect keyboards with adjustable actuation points for this purpose.

This project is for those of us who don't want to spend $200 on a new keyboard just for Apex movement.

It also helps the case that the trick is hittable on 60-120FPS with ease, meaning it isnt automating inhuman feats.
The cfg abusers were far worse before it got patched out, and that was simply using in-game tools to achieve inhuman feats.
You are still kind of a loser for using something like this (not to say anything about the developer).
